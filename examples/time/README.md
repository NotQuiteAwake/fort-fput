# Timing experiments

Here are some examples aimed at understanding what happens when we alter the
nonlinearity factor $\alpha$. They are generated by running in the project root:

```{.bash}
python pysrc/time.py
```

Many other parameters can be varied in much the same way as in `time.py` by
using the `Specs.export()` method, and piping the config to the compiled `fput`
binary. However, there is little point in doing that as variation in most of
them can be decomposed into some of the following:

- A change in the nonlinearity factor $\alpha$
- A scaling of the natural time scale (period of 1st harmonic)
- A simultaneous scaling of force and amplitude, while recurrence time is the
  same

Clearly, only the first of these three changes is of real interest. The results
are obtained with code at commit `54af052`.

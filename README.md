# FPUT problem

This Fortran code explores the [Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou(FPUT)
problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou_problem) in
chaos theory by simulating a 1D chain with non-linear dynamics with [symplectic
integrators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_integrator).

It is a work in progress. New code will be committed (hopefully) regularly.
